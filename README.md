## What is Brunch?
Brunch is a framework that aims to create a generic x86_64 Chrome OS image that can be installed on non-standard hardware. I'd suggest reading up on the project at its official source: https://github.com/sebanc/brunch

## How to Use
- Open a terminal with CTRL + ALT + T (For brunch users, type "shell" at the prompt)
- Type: `bash <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WesBosch/brunch-toolkit/main/install_toolkit.sh)` 
- The toolkit can now be launched with `brunch-toolkit` and updated using the steps above or through its own menu.
- Follow the on-screen prompts. If something requires that you download a file, the script will probably offer to do it for you.

## Usage
This script is designed to make installing and updating brunch easy for users that are not comfortable with the command line. If you already know what you're doing, some tasks may be faster to so manually. The toolkit will provide easy to follow prompts and present options whenever necessary for the user to select from. Some advanced features require update files, recoveries or boot splash archives to be in the ~/Downloads folder. It is not required to unzip anything, the toolkit will do that. If no usable files are found, the user will be able to download them. (if there is a suitable internet connection)

It is not a perfect script, if you find any issues, please report them. It is difficult to account for every possible situation, but I've made an attempt to cover most of them. This toolkit is intended to be used on devices running Sebanc's Brunch framework, though it has some limited functionality on standard **buntu* and Debian-based Linux distros.
